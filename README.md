# L-System

## What is L-System?

[Lindemeyer system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) is a notation for self-repeating geometric structures.

  An L-system consists of a set of letters (variables and constants) used, an axiom (the first word) and a set of production rules. The production rules are applied on each letter of a word. Variables commonly produce new words and constants only produce themselves.
